The basic functionality of the app is to have a good recommendation system

When a user swipes right he likes the product and the product should be saved in the wishlist 

when the user left swipes he dislikes the product and similar products having similar properties should be shown less and the disliked product should not be shown again until 25 swipes, after 25 swipes it should be showed once and if its disliked again it should not be shown ever again.

Every 10 swipes a random new product should be shown which is outside the preference, this is just to explore new products and create new preference.
